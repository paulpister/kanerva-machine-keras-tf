# kanerva-machine-keras-tf
Implementation of the paper The Kanerva Machine: A Generative Distributed Memory in tensorflow and keras.

The Kanerva Machine can be viewed as an extension of a Variational Autoencoder with a memory.

This model is inspired by Kanerva's Sparse Distributed Memory

The code is not ready for testing yet, what's left to do before testing :
-create the MLP layer
-implement the loss function
-implement derivation for online update rule
